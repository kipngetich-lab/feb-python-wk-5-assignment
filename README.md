# This program answers the following questions

## Question 1
- Create a class representing anything you like (a Smartphone, Book, or even a Superhero!).
- Add attributes and methods to bring the class to life!
- Use constructors to initialize each object with unique values.
- Add an inheritance layer to explore polymorphism or encapsulation.

## Question 2
Create a program that includes animals or vehicles with the same action (like move()). However, make each class define move() differently (for example, Car.move() prints "Driving" üöó, while Plane.move() prints "Flying" ‚úàÔ∏è)
